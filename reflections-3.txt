When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to be able to interact and collaborate with other people. Or be able to access your work from any computer
with network access.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
--So anything you were working on isn't automatically updated and thrashes any of your files. Doing so manually ensures you're ready for the update and not worried about messing with any of your code... Hopefully!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
--Forks makes a copy of a GitHub repo to your own account. You might fork a repo if you don't have the repo owners permission to make changes.
--Clones allow you to copy a repo. This I guess could be used as a backup if you're really worried of losing data! 
--Branches allow you to 'branch' off into another direction on a repo. You would use a branch if you're working on a repo and would like to make new changes that you might not be ready to commit altogether into your master branch until it is fully working and operational.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
--This allows you to work offline with the latest changes commited in origin. This also allows you to update your private
branches to contain those changes committed to origin.
