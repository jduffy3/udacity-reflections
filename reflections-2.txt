How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

--It allows you to create meaningful commits that are cleanly separated and logical

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

--Creating new features, working on bug fixes. They would help by separating your code into separate areas containing only items related to what you're working on rather than having everything all in one place.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
--As a parent child tree structure or more formally a Directed Acyclic Graph

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
--Because the merge involves merging two separate pieces of work into one. This means there is a set of parents that need to be represented and results one finished piece representing two separate bodies of work.
